Metal Prices API with Pandas
This project aims to provide a simple and convenient way to access metal prices data using an API and process it using the Pandas library. The project includes a Python script that retrieves real-time metal prices from a specified API and performs various data manipulation and analysis tasks using Pandas.

Features
Retrieve real-time metal prices: The script connects to the Metal Prices API and fetches up-to-date prices for various metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.

Data processing with Pandas: The project utilizes the powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities of the Pandas library to perform various operations on the retrieved data.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x: The project is built using Python, so you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Pandas: The Pandas library is used extensively for data manipulation and analysis. You can install it by running pip install pandas.

Metalpriceapiclient: makes api intergration and calls easy.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
